# LuaBindingsGenerator

This project is originated from [StarryX](https://github.com/wzhengsen/StarryX/tree/Develop/tools/SolBinding) and is used to generate lua bindings for [LuaSTG-x](https://github.com/Xrysnow/LuaSTG-x) and some other projects.

You need to download a release (`LLVM-xxx-win64.exe` or `clang+llvm-xxx.tar.xz`) from [llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) and put `libclang.dll`/`libclang.dylib`/`libclang.so` into `libclang` folder. The version should be corresponding with `libclang/VERSION.txt`.
